# Data Incubator Projects 
Dynamic Portfolio Construction on Black-Litterman Framework - Using the performance history of analysts' view

## Plot 1

The purpose of Plot 1 is to obtain the better understanding of each analyst's strong and weak point with respect to specific stocks,
specific sector, specific holding period. As we gather more information about analyst's analysis, we can come up with tendency and 
characteristics of each analyst by comparing it with overall market view from Tweeter sentiment analysis. We can also find 
correlation between the view of different analysts.

Let's look at the historic price chart.

Amazon's 2014 historic chart shows that the price generally goes down even though there were some ups and downs. If we 
look at some analyst's view during these period,

Analyst | Jan| Feb | Mar | Jun | Aug| Oct | Dec 
------|----  | ----| ----| --- | ---| --- | ---
'A'| short|   short | short| short| short | | short
'B'|      | long | short| long | short | short | short
'C'|short | short| short| |     neutral| short| long

<from 'seekingalpha.com'>

Analyst 'A' shows all time short for this stock. His view is more long term which represent the overall price down. However, analyst
'B' recommended long in Feb and Jun while analyst 'A' still insist 'short' in June. There was actually price up in June. Analyst 'B'
saw more short term return in this case which can be a good recommendation if the holding period of our investing is relatively short.  


In this way, we can understand each analyst's view and make the most of the industry expert's valuable insight very effectively.
